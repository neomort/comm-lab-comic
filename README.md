# Comm Lab Comic Assignment
## Project Name: Year of the 50th
## Contributors: Kyle Adams, Cole Beasley, Maaz Ahmed
### Project Description
For the comic assignment, we thought it would be cool to create something which was specific to our university or to the UAE. During our first meeting, Cole reminded us that the UAE would be celebrating its 50th National Day this year, and so we decided to portray the history of the UAE in the form of an interactive comic. The idea was to create a scrolling comic which would cover the entire period from the time when nomadic tribes lived in the region to the modern-day UAE. As we scrolled down the page, some of the most significant events in the history of the UAE would appear until we finally got to the celebration of the 50th National Day.
### Process
We first made a list of important events in the history of the UAE that we wanted to include in the comic. Once we had this list, we made a [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/NA4bJx07pnpP9l8OIhXYYF/UAE-Comic?node-id=3%3A18) (thanks for Figma, Kyle) and a list of all illustrations we needed (buildings, people and more) which allowed us to have a good basic idea of what we wanted on the final version of the comic. Next, we used Illustrator to make SVGs of some of the most prominent buildings in the UAE, of the nomadic people in the region, of Sheikh Zayed and more (all images on the website are SVGs and we made them ourselves). This was a time-consuming process but really allowed us (read: Maaz) to get more comfortable with using Illustrator.
